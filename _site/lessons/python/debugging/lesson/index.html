<h2 id="preface">Preface:</h2>

<p>Debugging is really an art form. In this tutorial, we’ll cover some concepts and tools you can use for debugging, but the skills need time to develop.</p>

<p>The tutorial breaks debugging into three basic steps: testing code, finding bugs, and fixing them. Testing is a large topic on its own – there’s even a <a href="http://pythontesting.net/start-here/">blog/podcast about it</a>. We’ll only cover some basics and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/unittest.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">unittest</code></a> framework, so you may want to check out that blog to learn more.</p>

<p>The bulk of this tutorial is about finding bugs. The only tools required are Python (<code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb</code> is included) and a text editor. However, I will give a demo using <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder">Spyder</a> to show how an IDE can help. Many other IDEs have the same (or more) features, but Spyder was convenient for me and is FOSS (free as in beer and speech).</p>

<p>Fixing bugs is very code specific, thus not covered in detail.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-debugging">What is debugging?</h2>

<p>Quoting Wikipedia, “Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system.”
In reality, it is a very large topic with many different methodologies and steps. We’re going to focus on finding bugs, and talk a little about prevention.</p>

<p>There are two forms of finding bugs: discovering their existence (testing), and searching for the cause in the code (finding). The debugging cycle typically goes</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>test -&gt; find -&gt; fix -&gt; test -&gt; ...
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>There’s a whole range of things that fall under testing, from running the program and seeing if it gives you the output you want to a full suite of unit tests run every time you commit your changes. In Python, the most common form of testing is through <em>interactive debugging</em> using the REPL.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code># Demonstrate here
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The REPL has been a major feature of interpreted languages like Python for good reason: quick and dirty testing.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t know how a library function behaves? Test it in the REPL.</li>
  <li>Unsure of your syntax? Check it in the REPL.</li>
  <li>Not sure how to tackle a problem? Try it step by step with some test data in the REPL.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where this form of testing falls through is consistency and automation. Every time the developer makes a change, she has to remember what to test and type it into the command line. Even with tab completion, or copy and paste, this is repetitive and tests will be missed.</p>

<p>That’s where unit tests come in. Unit tests are the smallest testable parts of a program. That smallness of them makes them easier to automate, and also (as we’ll see) easier to debug. Python includes a module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/unittest.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">unittest</code></a> that can handle this work flow.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s make a function that will split a list in the middle. It will take a list of arbitrary length, and return a tuple containing (first half, middle element, last half). We’ll follow a Test Driven Design (TDD) style, and create the tests first. This clearly defines the behaviour.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>import unittest

class TestSplitter(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_simple_case(self):
        self.assertTupleEqual(splitter([1, 2, 3]), ([1], 2, [3]))

    # TODO: More tests (hint: length of list)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A good testing suite should include a few examples of normal/expected input as well as any edge cases you can think of. Let’s fill in more tests now.</p>

<p>Now, run the suite (which will get us into debugging/finding mode)</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>python test_splitter.py
# or
python -m unittest
# or
python -m unittest -v test_splitter
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>(The <code class="highlighter-rouge">unittest</code> module has <em>test discovery</em> that will search for tests in the current directory using some rules.)</p>

<p>First, we’ll suppress the errors by actually defining the function. Next, we’ll come up with a solution (and hopefully make a few mistakes along the way.</p>

<h2 id="finding-bugs">Finding bugs</h2>

<p>After discovering that a bug exists, the next challenge is finding where the bug is in code. We’ve already seen how unit testing can help narrow it down to a function, but what if that function is more complicated, or we get an error, or the bug came up in use and not in testing?</p>

<p>There are a few tools for this.</p>

<p>Fist, stack traces. These are the messages the Python interpreter gives when there’s an uncaught exception. At first, they may seem cryptic, but it’s pretty straight-forward. From bottom to top, the trace prints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the error type and message (e.g. SyntaxError, IndexError, …)</li>
  <li>[the line in which the error happened]</li>
  <li>the function in which the error happened, along with the filename and line number</li>
  <li>The filename, line number, and function that called the function with the error (and all the way up the stack)</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll see an example of this with a partially working <code class="highlighter-rouge">splitter</code> function.</p>

<h3 id="print-debugging">Print debugging</h3>
<p>Sometimes the stack trace isn’t enough, like when a function returns the wrong value, or you’re not sure if a loop is behaving properly. The quick fall-back for this is to insert print statements wherever you’re unsure of the value.</p>

<p>Let’s do a little debugging of a broken average-taking function.</p>

<h3 id="using-pdb">Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb</code></h3>

<p>This is the more sophisticated way. You may have noticed that one annoyance with <code class="highlighter-rouge">print</code> is that you need to quit and restart python whenever the function definition is changed. Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb</code>, the execution is interrupted, and we can check the values of variables whenever we like.</p>

<p>To use <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb</code>, you first need to import it, and add the line <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb.set_trace()</code> where you’d like to start doing introspection. e.g.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>import pdb

def average(xs):
    pdb.set_trace()
    length = len(xs)
    acc = 0
    for i in range(1, length):
        acc = acc + xs[i]
    return acc/length
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next, when the execution is interrupted, use the commands</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">p &lt;variable&gt;</code> for printing the value of a variable</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code> to execute the next line</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">s</code> to step into a function call</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code> to continue execution</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">!&lt;code&gt;</code> to run any line of python (including changing values)</li>
</ul>

<p>Lets repeat the demo for <code class="highlighter-rouge">average()</code> using the debugger in Spyder (which just runs <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdb</code> for us).</p>

<p>Note: sometimes print debugging is still useful, like in a loop if you don’t want to stop every iteration, but want to see the values as they come up.</p>

<h3 id="helping-the-user">Helping the user</h3>

<p>There are a couple other problems with using <code class="highlighter-rouge">print()</code> for debugging:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you may forget to remove a print statement</li>
  <li>it messes up unit tests</li>
  <li>it corrupts the useful output to the user with debugging output</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, it’s better to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial"><code class="highlighter-rouge">logging</code></a> module.</p>

<p>Using <code class="highlighter-rouge">logging.debug()</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">print()</code> lets you output the debugging statements to a file, instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">stdout</code>. An example from the python docs,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log',level=logging.DEBUG)
logging.debug('This message should go to the log file')
logging.info('So should this')
logging.warning('And this, too')
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Creating logs this way will also automatically format the messages (which you can customize). This is a good way to provide debugging data to your users, like warnings that their data is in the wrong format or that another function is better.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-mention-of-reporting-bugs">A brief mention of reporting bugs</h3>

<p>It should also be mentioned that users can report bugs to developers. Each project likely has its own bug tracking system, but GitHub and other hosts provide issue trackers. It’s a good idea to let users report bugs, and to report bugs in other projects that you use.</p>

<p>With more practice in fixing bugs, you’ll also have a better idea of what should be included in a bug report.</p>
